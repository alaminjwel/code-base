# Terraform Validate Docker Project
# You are provided a main.tf file which is a partially written Terraform configuration file. Your goal is to modify this file so that the command terraform validate returns a success response.

# The missing settings are: you need to provide a source set to "kreuzwerker/docker" and a version set to "~> 3.0.1" in the docker provider.

# You also need to provide a ports setting for the docker_container resource, with values for internal and external being 80 and 8000.
