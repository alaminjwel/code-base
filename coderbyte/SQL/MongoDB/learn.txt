Great question! MongoDB provides several arithmetic and logical operators that can be used in aggregation pipelines, queries, and updates:

Arithmetic Operators:

$add: Adds two or more values together.
$subtract: Subtracts a value from another value.
$multiply: Multiplies two or more values together.
$divide: Divides a value by another value.
$mod: Calculates the remainder of a division operation.
Logical Operators:

$and: Joins query clauses with a logical AND operator to return all documents that match all conditions.
$or: Joins query clauses with a logical OR operator to return all documents that match at least one condition.
$not: Negates the result of a query expression.
$nor: Joins query clauses with a logical NOR operator to return all documents that do not match any condition.
There are also other comparison operators such as $eq, $ne, $lt, $lte, $gt, and $gte that can be used for filtering documents based on field values.

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
